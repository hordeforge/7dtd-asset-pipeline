# Research provenance

This project generalizes a working pipeline from the `AtomicDoomsday` mod in
`ywy50/7dtd-mods`. No Atomic Doomsday art or deployable bundle is copied here.

## 7DTD engine-resolution facts

The source project recorded these against 7 Days to Die V3.1.0 b14 by
decompiling the installed `Assembly-CSharp.dll` with `ilspycmd` and/or
`monodis`:

- `ModManager.PatchModPathString` resolves `@modfolder(Name):` using the
  `ModInfo.xml` internal name;
- `DataLoader.ParseDataPathIdentifier` splits bundle path and asset at `?`;
- `AssetBundleManager.LoadAssetBundle` opens the bundle lazily;
- `AssetBundleManager._get` reduces the asset request to file-name stem;
- block model loading subsequently checks the loaded object name, making exact
  case significant;
- item mesh and audio loading traverse the same `DataLoader` family, through
  `DataLoader.LoadAsset<T>` for `GameObject`, `Transform`, and `AudioClip`;
- `Audio.Manager.LoadAudio` resolves a `sounds.xml` `ClipName` bundle URI
  through that same path, and plays nothing beyond the AudioSource prefab's
  `maxDistance`, so a long-range sound needs a mod-owned AudioSource;
- `Audio.Manager.Play` switches to a sound node's `DistantClip` only past
  `DistantFadeStart` metres and stops the near clip past `DistantFadeEnd`;
  `DistantFadeStart` defaults to `-1`, meaning never, so a distant variant
  authored without setting it is never heard;
- `SoundsFromXml.ParseNode` reads each `SoundDataNode`'s `AudioSource`,
  `AudioClip`, and `DistantClip` — which is why a bundle URI works in all three
  — plus `Loop`, `AltSound`, `Noise`, `MaxVoices`, `MaxVoicesPerEntity`,
  `MaxRepeatRate`, `LowestPitch`, `HighestPitch`, `Channel`, `Priority`, and
  the crouch/noise scales, all matched case-insensitively from each element's
  first attribute; it also calls `DataLoader.PreloadBundle` on those names at
  parse time;
- `ItemClass.Init` parses `SoundTick` as `"<group>[,<delaySeconds>]"` with a
  one-second default, and `ItemClassTimeBomb.OnDroppedUpdate` plays it through
  `Entity.PlayOneShot` once per `SoundTickDelay` while `Meta` is above zero;
- `ItemClassesFromXml` and `BlocksFromXml` copy **every** parent property that
  the `Extends` `param1` exclusion list does not name. Deleting a property from
  a child definition therefore does not stop it being inherited — it must be
  excluded by name. Found live: a mod item's own `TintColor` line was removed
  and vanilla's red grenade tint kept multiplying the new olive paint, with a
  clean log, a loading bundle, and a resolving prefab;
- `ItemClassTimeBomb.setActivationTransformsActive` uses `FindInChilds`, which
  also finds inactive children, so an `ActivationTransformToHide` child is
  authored **active** and the engine hides it when holding starts;
- `ModManager.LoadUiAtlases` loads each immediate subfolder of a mod's
  `UIAtlases/` as a runtime-packed atlas, keyed by folder name, with each PNG
  keyed by its filename stem. The V3 item atlas cell measured **160 x 160**,
  read from the installed game's own
  `Data/Addressables/Standalone/automatic_assets_generic/itemicons.bundle`;
  `CustomIconTint` multiplies the icon's colour, so a leftover tint silently
  recolours new art;
- `BlockShapeModelEntity.getPrefab` substitutes `block_missingPrefab`, and
  items fall back to `@:Other/Items/Crafting/leather.fbx`, so a failed load
  still draws something and cannot be ruled out by eye;
- `ItemClass.GetDroppedCorrectionRotation` returns `(-90, 0, 0)`, and
  `ItemClass.CloneModel` applies `UpdateLight.SetTintColor`, which multiplies
  every material `_Color` by the item's `TintColor`.

Re-verify these method bodies after a major game update. The current CLI gates
encode their consequences but do not decompile the game automatically.

## Class-142 finding

The originating investigation compared rejected mod bundles with current stock
game bundles using a hand-written UnityFS/SerializedFile reader and UnityPy.
Both used the same Unity revision and Windows platform metadata, but rejected
bundles lacked class 142. Unity's own build log reported that AssetBundle and
particle modules were disabled; the project package manifest was empty.

Adding the built-in modules, forcing a full rebuild, and rejecting the warning
produced a class-142 container that a fresh client loaded. This pipeline keeps
all four lessons:

1. package modules are build inputs;
2. disabled-module warnings are fatal;
3. class 142 is a required artifact gate;
4. fresh-client acceptance remains required.

## Official and community references

- Unity `BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles`:
  <https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles.html>
- Unity AssetBundle Browser:

- UnityPy: <https://github.com/K0lb3/UnityPy>
- AssetsTools.NET: <https://github.com/nesrak1/AssetsTools.NET>

The OCB exporter informed the Windows graphics-API set and remains a useful
comparison. Exporter API shape alone did not fix the missing container; module
inclusion did.

## Current-version evidence

At extraction time, the configured local **V 3.1.0 b14** install's shipped
`Data/Bundles/Standalone/Entities/Entities` reported Unity **2022.3.62f2**,
changeset **7670c08855a9** — the same pairing the source project pinned in
`ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` and hardcoded in its editor installer.
Unity's release service independently resolves that revision to the same
changeset and to the windows-mono module MD5 `b5adce741fb7633c039e216348110332`
the source project had hardcoded, which is how the generalized installer
replaces that table without losing accuracy.
The Atomic Doomsday bundle reported the same revision, contained class 142,
and all seven of its XML bundle references passed the source validator.

That version is evidence for the extraction, not a forever constant. New
consumer projects discover their installed game's revision.

## Live verification of the class-142 finding

The extraction inherited the class-142 rule from the source project's
investigation. It has since been reproduced directly against Unity 2022.3.62f2
and the same installed game, which is stronger evidence than inheritance:

With `Packages/manifest.json` emptied, Unity **exited zero** while logging

```text
'AssetBundle' is not supported because the module AssetBundle is disabled in the build.
'BoxCollider' is not supported because the module Physics is disabled in the build.
```

and wrote a bundle whose serialized class table was `[33, 1, 21, 48, 4, 23]` —
no class 142. The pipeline rejected it on the log gate, and the previously
staged bundle was left byte-identical. Restoring the manifest produced a
class-142 bundle that passed every gate.

## Module resolution is not module declaration

Testing the above turned up a fact worth recording, because it changes what
"remove a module" means. Deleting `com.unity.modules.assetbundle` from
`manifest.json` did **not** remove it: `packages-lock.json` pinned the
previously resolved set, and after deleting the lock the module returned at
`depth: 1`, pulled in transitively by
`com.unity.modules.unitywebrequestassetbundle` and
`com.unity.modules.unitywebrequestwww`.

So a mod usually acquires the AssetBundle module by accident and works, and
`doctor`'s manifest check is necessary but not sufficient: what ships is what
Unity resolved, not what was declared. The class-142 artifact gate is what
actually decides, which is why it inspects the built file rather than the
project.
